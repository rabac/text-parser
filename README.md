# text-parser
A simple parser which parses words from a file and displays the 10 most frequent words occurring in the file. 

Using a supplied sample text file (tempest.txt), English locale and treating hyphen and apostrophe as part of a word, the program gives the following output:

`ParseResult [name=tempest.txt, word-orrurrences={and=514, the=513, i=446, to=324, a=310, of=295, my=288, you=211, that=188, this=185}]`

# To run the program locally
* Run jar file using `java -jar text-parser-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`
* Open the link [localhost:8080/parse](localhost:8080/parse)
