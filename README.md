# text-parser
A simple parser which parses words from a file and displays the 10 most frequent words occurring in the file. 

Using a supplied sample text file (tempest.txt), English locale and treating hyphen and apostrophe as part of a word, the program gives the following output:
and (514)
the (513)
i (446)
to (324)
a (310)
of (295)
my (288)
you (211)
that (188)
this (185)

To see the output, run the program locally using java -jar and access the link localhost:8080/parse
